# poem_quality_evaluation
This repository is a final group project for «Neural network methods in text processing» course at HSE university

## Main idea
The network takes a poem and evaluates it by several parameters: rhyme, rhythm, novelty, repetition, meaningfulness, emotionality, (grammaticality)

## The parameters
#### rhyme

#### rhythm

#### novelty
a poem is compared to the corpora to check its uniqueness, originality
#### repetition
checks if there is variation between lines within a poem
#### meaningfulness
0 - poem makes no sense, 1 - less than half of a poem makes sense, 2 - more than half of a poem makes sense, 3 - there are no mistakes considering sense
#### emotionality
1 - emotional, 0 - not emotional
#### grammaticality
1 - everything is correct, 0 - there is at least one mistake
